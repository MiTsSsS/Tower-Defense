# Purpose

I made this project because I am interested in the different aspects behind placing objects in the game world and using NavMesh to make agents navigate their way from point A to point B, I then decided to complete it as a small playable Tower Defense game.
  
# Gameplay
- The player is able to place 3 types of towers by paying their cost.
- Gold is earned overtime and by killing enemy units.
- Enemy units travel from point A to point B, if they reach point B they will dissapear and the bar in the top middle of the screen will increase.
- If the bar is filled, the player loses and the game will restart.
  
# Future Work
- Preview tower range before placing it.
- Timer and Score counter.
- Gradual increase for the game difficulty based on elapsed time since its start.
